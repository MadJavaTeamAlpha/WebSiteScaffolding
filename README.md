In order to run this program you must install wget.


After running the application in intelliJ, enter the following on the command line:

* wget -r --no-parent "http://localhost:9998/css/framework/script" -O outputFile.zip

* Where css is the parameter for whether or not you'd like a basic css file with your scaffold.
** choose 'Y' or 'N' or 'null'
* Where framework is which reponsive framework you like included with your scaffold
** choose 'bootstrap' or 'foundation' or 'null'
* Where script is any scripting files you'd like with your scaffold,
** choose 'js', 'jQuery', 'jForm', or 'null'
* Where outputFile.zip is the name you'd like to give to your zipped folder
** choose anything you'd like.

example:  wget -r --no-parent "http://localhost:9998/Y/bootstrap/jForm" -O myFolder.zip


It's working now.  
Run the main method of scaffolding.java and try this url in the browser:

http://localhost:9998/y/bootstrap/jform

Give scaffolding.java a while to get going... like 45sec or so.
